# Gazebo_Essentials


This repo serves as a tutorial for running gazebo simulations with ROS2. At the time of writing this tutorial, I was using ROS2 Iron and Gazebo 11.



# Gazebo Components

# Robot Model
- Xacro
- URDF: Can be generated automatically using Xacro


# World Model
- xml documents (.world files) that specifies the world layout and populates it with other objects.
